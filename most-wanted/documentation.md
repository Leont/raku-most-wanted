# Most Wanted Documentation and Tutorials

Sometimes, the documentation (references for operations, function, methods, etc.) 
does not follow the speed of development. Some features and language constructions
are poorly documented and need to be addressed in order to reach a
wider audience. You can also
check
[this issue comment](https://github.com/perl6/doc/issues/114#issuecomment-327243953) for
missing pages. 


## Documentation
